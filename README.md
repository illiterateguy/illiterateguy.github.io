Web Programming with Python and JavaScript


hey guys ,i have learnt a lot about css and bootstrap and have worked on it 2 days straight. now it looks somewhat appealing to me, hope it does to you.


1. index.html is the home page introducing myself
2. education.html contains my academics and interests
3. projects.html contains the projects,internships and  moocs i did.
4. contact.html contains a form(ps: which cannot be submitted) to contact me
   and my other contact handles. here i have used @media query to remove contact handles to footer below 600px. (though bootstrap does it already but puts it above)
5. amber4.jpg contains the pic i used in index.html
6. contact.jpg contains the pic i have used as background image in contact.html
7. scssfiles contains resume.css (all the scss i used in making)
8. cssfiles contains resume.css(from resume.scss) and resume1.css(same as resume.css , made this because i had to write css first because i could not download 
command line sass on wsl(please help) and then convert it to scss. did so because
it was hard again - again converting scss to css through gui app scout)
